Hey there!

I am Bernhard and this is my personal page.
I am a software engineer somewhere around HPC, GPU and graphics programming,
currently based at CERN, Geneva, Switzerland.
C++ is a big passion of mine, both professionally and privately,
so I dedicate this webpage to some occasional ideas around the language!
